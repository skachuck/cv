abstract={Arctic sea ice can be classified as first-year (FY) or multiyear (MY) based on data collected by satellite microwave scatterometers. The Oceansat-2 Ku-band Scatterometer (OSCAT) was operational from 2009 to 2014 and is here used to classify ice as FY or MY during these years. Due to similarities in backscatter measurements from sea ice and open water, a NASA Team ice concentration product derived from passive microwave brightness temperatures is used to restrict the classification area to within the sea ice extent. Classification of FY and MY ice is completed with OSCAT by applying a temporally adjusted threshold on backscatter values. The classification method is also applied to the Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) data set, and ice age classifications are processed using QuikSCAT for 1999-2009. The combined QuikSCAT and OSCAT classifications represent a 15-year record, which extends from 1999 to 2014. The classifications show a decrease in MY ice, while the total area of the ice cover remains consistent throughout winter seasons over the time series.},

abstract = {The concentration, type, and extent of sea ice in the Arctic can be estimated based on measurements from satellite active microwave sensors, passive microwave sensors, or both. Here, data from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) are employed to broadly classify Arctic sea ice type as first-year (FY) or multiyear (MY). Combining data from both active and passive sensors can improve the performance of MY and FY ice classification. The classification method uses C-band   σ0     measurements from ASCAT and 37 GHz brightness temperature measurements from SSMIS to derive a probabilistic model based on a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Using a Gaussian model, a Bayesian estimator selects between FY and MY ice to classify pixels in images of Arctic sea ice. The ASCAT/SSMIS classification results are compared with classifications using the Oceansat-2 scatterometer (OSCAT), the Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) Sea Ice Age dataset available from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), and the Canadian Ice Service (CIS) charts, also available from the NSIDC. The MY ice extent of the ASCAT/SSMIS classifications demonstrates an average difference of 282 thousand km  - +  from that of the OSCAT classifications from 2009 to 2014. The difference is an average of 13.6\% of the OSCAT MY ice extent, which averaged 2.19 million km2     over the same period. Compared to the ice classified as two years or older in the EASE-Grid Sea Ice Age dataset (EASE-2+) from 2009 to 2012, the average difference is 617 thousand km2. The difference is an average of 22.8\% of the EASE-2+ MY ice extent, which averaged 2.79 million km2     from 2009 to 2012. Comparison with the Canadian Ice Service (CIS) charts shows that most ASCAT/SSMIS classifications of MY ice correspond to a MY ice concentration of approximately 50\% or greater in the CIS charts. The addition of the passive SSMIS data appears to improve classifications by mitigating misclassifications caused by ASCAT's sensitivity to rough patches of ice which can appear similar to, but are not, MY ice.},

abstract={Satelliteborne C-band scatterometer measurements of the radar backscatter coefficient  (\sigma ^{0}) of the Earth can be used to estimate soil moisture levels over land. Such estimates are currently produced at 25- and 50-km resolution using the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) sensor and a change detection algorithm originally developed at the Vienna University of Technology (TU-Wien). Using the ASCAT spatial response function (SRF), high-resolution (approximately 15–20 km per pixel) images of  \sigma ^{0} can be produced, enabling the creation of a high-resolution soil moisture product using a modified version of the TU-Wien algorithm. The high-resolution soil moisture images are compared to images produced with the Water Retrieval Package 5.5 algorithm, which is also based on the TU-Wien algorithm, and to in situ measurements from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration U.S. Climate Reference Network (NOAA CRN). The WARP 5.5 and high-resolution image products generally show good agreement with each other; the high-resolution estimates appear to resolve soil moisture features at a finer scale and demonstrate a tendency toward greater moisture values in some areas. When compared to volumetric soil moisture measurements from NOAA CRN stations for 2010 and 2011, the WARP 5.5 and high-resolution soil moisture estimates perform similarly, with both having a root-mean-square difference from the in situ data of approximately 0.06 m3/m3 in one study area and 0.09 m3/m3 in another.},
