abstract = {A freely cooling granular gas in a gravitational field undergoes a collapse to a multicontact state in a finite time. Previous theoretical [D. Volfson et al., Phys. Rev. E 73, 061305 (2006)] and experimental work [R. Son et al., Phys. Rev. E 78, 041302 (2008)] have obtained contradictory results about the rate of energy loss before the gravitational collapse. Here we use a molecular dynamics simulation in an attempt to recreate the experimental and theoretical results to resolve the discrepancy. We are able to nearly match the experimental results, and find that to reproduce the power law predicted in the theory we need a nearly elastic system with a constant coefficient of restitution greater than 0.993. For the more realistic velocity-dependent coefficient of restitution, there does not appear to be a power-law decay and the transition from granular gas to granular solid is smooth, making it difficult to define a time of collapse.},

abstract = {We study shock wave formation and propagation in an experimental vertically driven quasi-two-dimensional granular gas. We measure the moments of the single particle velocity distribution as a function of space and time. The space-time fields of the velocity moments show acoustic waves with a serrated substructure on the scale of a particle diameter. We show that this substructure is the result of collisional transport in which sequential collisions each transport momentum and energy by one particle diameter.}
