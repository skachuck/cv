abstract = {The ice load configuration of the Barents Sea Ice Sheet (BSIS) over the last glacial cycle is in dispute. The traditional reconstruction, motivated by the observation that paleo-shoreline emergence increases toward the center of the Barents Sea, places a single dome in the center of the Barents Sea at the last glacial maximum (LGM) that collapses to island centered loads during deglaciation. Observations that suggest that ice flowed from the islands into the Barents even at the LGM motivate another reconstruction that places the ice loads over the islands with minimal marine ice. We analyze an ensemble of ice loads that are consistent with the geophysical observations using relatively new statistical methods and show that current relative sea level, GPS and gravity measurement do not and cannot distinguish a central dome from an island-centered BSIS. What is needed are constraints in the central Barents Sea.  Improving the gravity data sufficiently will be difficult.  However, obtaining even a single GPS uplift rate measurement in the central Barents would resolve the central dome versus island centered BSIS geometry question.  The Barents Sea ice load geometry uncertainty provides a good illustration of statistical methods that may be useful in other areas of glaciology.    },

abstract = {A freely cooling granular gas in a gravitational field undergoes a collapse to a multicontact state in a finite time. Previous theoretical [D. Volfson et al., Phys. Rev. E 73, 061305 (2006)] and experimental work [R. Son et al., Phys. Rev. E 78, 041302 (2008)] have obtained contradictory results about the rate of energy loss before the gravitational collapse. Here we use a molecular dynamics simulation in an attempt to recreate the experimental and theoretical results to resolve the discrepancy. We are able to nearly match the experimental results, and find that to reproduce the power law predicted in the theory we need a nearly elastic system with a constant coefficient of restitution greater than 0.993. For the more realistic velocity-dependent coefficient of restitution, there does not appear to be a power-law decay and the transition from granular gas to granular solid is smooth, making it difficult to define a time of collapse.},

abstract = {We study shock wave formation and propagation in an experimental vertically driven quasi-two-dimensional granular gas. We measure the moments of the single particle velocity distribution as a function of space and time. The space-time fields of the velocity moments show acoustic waves with a serrated substructure on the scale of a particle diameter. We show that this substructure is the result of collisional transport in which sequential collisions each transport momentum and energy by one particle diameter.},
