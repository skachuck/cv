about: >
  I am in the final year of a Ph.D. in Geophysics at Cornell University. My interests 
  include fluid dynamics and statistical physics in general. My thesis research focuses 
  on computing how the earth responds to the mass redistributions of the last ice age, 
  when over 4 million Gigatons of water (about 3\% of the oceans) moved from the ocean 
  to the continents, and predicting the effects this is having sea level changes today
  using sparse surface observations.

  I believe that communicating and teaching science honestly is vitally important for its 
  continued success, perhaps now more than ever. I am thus dedicated to studying and 
  implementing modern pedagogical methods in my classrooms, presentations, and with my 
  peers in a way that emphasizes the social, historical, and human aspects of science.
